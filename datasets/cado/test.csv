Syntax: public delegate void DataGridViewAutoSizeModeEventHandler( Object sender, DataGridViewAutoSizeModeEventArgs e )
Parameters
senderType: System.Object
The source of the event. 
eType: System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewAutoSizeModeEventArgs
A DataGridViewAutoSizeModeEventArgs that contains the event data.
Summary: Represents the method that will handle the AutoSizeRowsModeChanged or RowHeadersWidthSizeModeChanged events of a DataGridView.
Remarks: The AutoSizeRowsModeChanged event is raised when the value of the AutoSizeRowsMode property of the DataGridView control changes. The RowHeadersWidthSizeModeChanged event is raised when the value of the RowHeadersWidthSizeMode property changes. When you create a DataGridViewAutoSizeModeEventHandler delegate, you identify the method that will handle the event. To associate the event with your event handler, add an instance of the delegate to the event. The event handler is called whenever the event occurs, unless you remove the delegate. For more information about event-handler delegates, information about event-handler delegates, see Events and Delegates.

Syntax: [AttributeUsageAttribute(AttributeTargets.Class|AttributeTargets.Struct, Inherited = false, AllowMultiple = false)] public sealed class CollectionDataContractAttribute : Attribute
Summary: When applied to a collection type, enables custom specification of the collection item elements. This attribute can be applied only to types that are recognized by the DataContractSerializer as valid, serializable collections.
Remarks: The CollectionDataContractAttribute is intended to ease interoperability when working with data from non- providers and to control the exact shape of serialized instances. To this end, the ItemName property enables you to control the names of the repeating items inside a collection. This is especially useful when the provider does not use the XML element type name as the array item name, for example, if a provider uses #String# as an element type name instead of the XSD type name #string#. The CollectionDataContractAttribute is also intended to be used with dictionary types to handle keyed collections. Dictionary types are classes that implement either the IDictionary or the IDictionary(Of TKey, TValue) interface, for example, the Dictionary(Of TKey, TValue). Use the KeyName and ValueName properties to set custom names when using the Dictionary(Of TKey, TValue) class. For more information about using the DataContractSerializer, see Data Contracts Overview.
Example: The following example applies the CollectionDataContractAttribute to a class that inherits from the List(Of T) class. The code sets the Name and ItemName properties to custom values.  When the Service Model Metadata Utility Tool (Svcutil.exe) is used to generate code for the client, the code resembles the following example. Notice that the name of the class is changed, as well as the ItemName. When using generics, the type parameter name is used to create the resulting type name.

Remarks: An empty set is a subset of any other collection, including an empty set; therefore, this method returns true if the collection represented by the current HashSet(Of T) object is empty, even if the other parameter is an empty set.

maximize the sharing of related resources.

compresses them by sharing across uses and taking advantage of their 
immutable nature. Since many styles are replicated, the potential for 
sharing is significant, and copies can be extremely cheap. Larger sets

33750,464857,468601,8,"public abstract class SwingWorker<T,V>   ","An abstract class to perform lengthy GUI-interacting tasks in a dedicated 
thread.

When writing a multi-threaded application using Swing, there are two 
constraints to keep in mind: (refer to How to Use Threads for more 
details):

    * Time-consuming tasks should not be run on the Event Dispatch Thread.
      Otherwise the application becomes unresponsive.
    * Swing components should be accessed on the Event Dispatch Thread 
      only.

These constraints mean that a GUI application with time intensive computing 
needs at least two threads: 1) a thread to perform the lengthy task and 2) 
the Event Dispatch Thread (EDT) for all GUI-related activities. This 
involves inter-thread communication which can be tricky to implement.

SwingWorker is designed for situations where you need to have a long 
running task run in a background thread and provide updates to the UI 
either when done, or while processing. Subclasses of SwingWorker must 
implement the doInBackground() method to perform the background 
computation.

Workflow

There are three threads involved in the life cycle of a SwingWorker :

    * Current thread: The execute() method is called on this thread. It
      schedules SwingWorker for the execution on a worker thread and
      returns immediately. One can wait for the SwingWorker to complete
      using the get methods.

    * Worker thread: The doInBackground() method is called on this thread.
      This is where all background activities should happen. To notify 
      PropertyChangeListeners about bound properties changes use the 
      firePropertyChange and getPropertyChangeSupport() methods. By default
      there are two bound properties available: state and progress.

    * Event Dispatch Thread: All Swing related activities occur on this
      thread. SwingWorker invokes the process and done() methods and
      notifies any PropertyChangeListeners on this thread.

Often, the Current thread is the Event Dispatch Thread.

Before the doInBackground method is invoked on a worker thread, 
SwingWorker notifies any PropertyChangeListeners about the state property 
change to StateValue.STARTED. After the doInBackground method is finished 
the done method is executed. Then SwingWorker notifies any 
PropertyChangeListeners about the state property change to StateValue.DONE
.

SwingWorker is only designed to be executed once. Executing a SwingWorker 
more than once will not result in invoking the doInBackground method twice.

Sample Usage

The following example illustrates the simplest use case. Some processing is 
done in the background and when done you update a Swing component.

Say we want to find the Meaning of Life and display the result in a 
JLabel.

 final JLabel label; class MeaningOfLifeFinder extends SwingWorker<String, Object> { @Override public String doInBackground() { return findTheMeaningOfLife(); }  @Override protected void done() { try { label.setText(get()); } catch (Exception ignore) { } } }  (new MeaningOfLifeFinder()).execute(); 

The next example is useful in situations where you wish to process data as 
it is ready on the Event Dispatch Thread.

Now we want to find the first N prime numbers and display the results in a 
JTextArea. While this is computing, we want to update our progress in a 
JProgressBar. Finally, we also want to print the prime numbers to 
System.out.

 class PrimeNumbersTask extends SwingWorker<List<Integer>, Integer> { PrimeNumbersTask(JTextArea textArea, int numbersToFind) { //initialize }  @Override public List<Integer> doInBackground() { while (! enough && ! isCancelled()) { number = nextPrimeNumber(); publish(number); setProgress(100 * numbers.size() / numbersToFind); } } return numbers; }  @Override protected void process(List<Integer> chunks) { for (int number : chunks) { textArea.append(number +  n); } } }  JTextArea textArea = new JTextArea(); final JProgressBar progressBar = new JProgressBar(0, 100); PrimeNumbersTask task = new PrimeNumbersTask(textArea, N); task.addPropertyChangeListener( new PropertyChangeListener() { public  void propertyChange(PropertyChangeEvent evt) { if (progress.equals(evt.getPropertyName())) { progressBar.setValue((Integer)evt.getNewValue()); } } });  task.execute(); System.out.println(task.get()); //prints all prime numbers we have got 

Because SwingWorker implements Runnable, a SwingWorker can be submitted to 
an Executor for execution.

32620,447584,451328,8,public interface ResultSet   ,"A table of data representing a database result set, which is usually 
generated by executing a statement that queries the database.

A ResultSet object maintains a cursor pointing to its current row of data. 
Initially the cursor is positioned before the first row. The next method 
moves the cursor to the next row, and because it returns false when there 
are no more rows in the ResultSet object, it can be used in a while loop to 
iterate through the result set.

A default ResultSet object is not updatable and has a cursor that moves 
forward only. Thus, you can iterate through it only once and only from the 
first row to the last row. It is possible to produce ResultSet objects that 
are scrollable and/or updatable. The following code fragment, in which con 
is a valid Connection object, illustrates how to make a result set that is 
scrollable and insensitive to updates by others, and that is updatable. See 
ResultSet fields for other options.

  Statement stmt = con.createStatement( ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE, ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE); ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(SELECT a, b FROM TABLE2); // rs will be scrollable, will not show changes made by others, // and will be updatable  

The ResultSet interface provides getter methods (getBoolean, getLong, and 
so on) for retrieving column values from the current row. Values can be 
retrieved using either the index number of the column or the name of the 
column. In general, using the column index will be more efficient. Columns 
are numbered from 1. For maximum portability, result set columns within 
each row should be read in left-to-right order, and each column should be 
read only once.

For the getter methods, a JDBC driver attempts to convert the underlying 
data to the Java type specified in the getter method and returns a suitable 
Java value. The JDBC specification has a table showing the allowable 
mappings from SQL types to Java types that can be used by the ResultSet 
getter methods.

Column names used as input to getter methods are case insensitive. When a 
getter method is called with a column name and several columns have the 
same name, the value of the first matching column will be returned. The 
column name option is designed to be used when column names are used in the 
SQL query that generated the result set. For columns that are NOT 
explicitly named in the query, it is best to use column numbers. If column 
names are used, the programmer should take care to guarantee that they 
uniquely refer to the intended columns, which can be assured with the SQL 
AS clause.

A set of updater methods were added to this interface in the JDBC 2.0 API 
(JavaTM 2 SDK, Standard Edition, version 1.2). The comments regarding 
parameters to the getter methods also apply to parameters to the updater 
methods.

The updater methods may be used in two ways:

   1. to update a column value in the current row. In a scrollable 
      ResultSet object, the cursor can be moved backwards and forwards, to
      an absolute position, or to a position relative to the current row.
      The following code fragment updates the NAME column in the fifth row
      of the ResultSet object rs and then uses the method updateRow to
      update the data source table from which rs was derived.

        rs.absolute(5); // moves the cursor to the fifth row of rs rs.updateString(NAME, AINSWORTH); // updates the // NAME column of row 5 to be AINSWORTH rs.updateRow(); // updates the row in the data source  

   2. to insert column values into the insert row. An updatable ResultSet 
      object has a special row associated with it that serves as a staging
      area for building a row to be inserted. The following code fragment
      moves the cursor to the insert row, builds a three-column row, and

A ResultSet object is automatically closed when the Statement object that 
generated it is closed, re-executed, or used to retrieve the next result 
from a sequence of multiple results.

The number, types and properties of a ResultSet object's columns are 
provided by the ResulSetMetaData object returned by the 
ResultSet.getMetaData method.

    Statement.executeQuery(java.lang.String), Statement.getResultSet(), 
    ResultSetMetaData","A table of data representing a database result set, which is usually  generated by executing a statement that queries the database.  A ResultSet object maintains a cursor pointing to its current row of data.  Initially the cursor is positioned before the first row. The next method  moves the cursor to the next row, and because it returns false when there  are no more rows in the ResultSet object, it can be used in a while loop to  iterate through the result set.  A default ResultSet object is not updatable and has a cursor that moves  forward only. Thus, you can iterate through it only once and only from the  first row to the last row. It is possible to produce ResultSet objects that  are scrollable and/or updatable. The following code fragment, in which con  is a valid Connection object, illustrates how to make a result set that is  scrollable and insensitive to updates by others, and that is updatable. See  ResultSet fields for other options.    Statement stmt = con.createStatement( ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE, ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE); ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(SELECT a, b FROM TABLE2); // rs will be scrollable, will not show changes made by others, // and will be updatable    The ResultSet interface provides getter methods (getBoolean, getLong, and  so on) for retrieving column values from the current row. Values can be  retrieved using either the index number of the column or the name of the  column. In general, using the column index will be more efficient. Columns  are numbered from 1. For maximum portability, result set columns within  each row should be read in left-to-right order, and each column should be  read only once.  For the getter methods, a JDBC driver attempts to convert the underlying  data to the Java type specified in the getter method and returns a suitable  Java value. The JDBC specification has a table showing the allowable  mappings from SQL types to Java types that can be used by the ResultSet  getter methods.  Column names used as input to getter methods are case insensitive. When a  getter method is called with a column name and several columns have the  same name, the value of the first matching column will be returned. The  column name option is designed to be used when column names are used in the  SQL query that generated the result set. For columns that are NOT  explicitly named in the query, it is best to use column numbers. If column  names are used, the programmer should take care to guarantee that they  uniquely refer to the intended columns, which can be assured with the SQL  AS clause.  A set of updater methods were added to this interface in the JDBC 2.0 API  (JavaTM 2 SDK, Standard Edition, version 1.2). The comments regarding  parameters to the getter methods also apply to parameters to the updater  methods.  The updater methods may be used in two ways:     1. to update a column value in the current row. In a scrollable        ResultSet object, the cursor can be moved backwards and forwards, to       an absolute position, or to a position relative to the current row.       The following code fragment updates the NAME column in the fifth row       of the ResultSet object rs and then uses the method updateRow to       update the data source table from which rs was derived.          rs.absolute(5); // moves the cursor to the fifth row of rs rs.updateString(NAME, AINSWORTH); // updates the // NAME column of row 5 to be AINSWORTH rs.updateRow(); // updates the row in the data source       2. to insert column values into the insert row. An updatable ResultSet        object has a special row associated with it that serves as a staging       area for building a row to be inserted. The following code fragment       moves the cursor to the insert row, builds a three-column row, and       inserts it into rs and into the data source table using the method        insertRow.          rs.moveToInsertRow(); // moves cursor to the insert row rs.updateString(1, AINSWORTH); // updates the // first column of the insert row to be AINSWORTH rs.updateInt(2,35); // updates the second column to be 35 rs.updateBoolean(3, true); // updates the third column to true rs.insertRow(); rs.moveToCurrentRow();    A ResultSet object is automatically closed when the Statement object that  generated it is closed, re-executed, or used to retrieve the next result  from a sequence of multiple results.

Syntax: public sealed class OperationContext : IExtensibleObject<OperationContext>
Summary: Provides access to the execution context of a service method.
Remarks: Use the OperationContext from within a service operation to access the current operation execution environment. In particular, the operation context is used to access callback channels in duplex services, to store extra state data across portions of the operations, and to access incoming message headers and properties as well as add outgoing message headers and properties. For more information about using extensions to store state data, see Extensible Objects. The OperationContext has the following properties and methods. The Current property returns the OperationContext object representing the current execution context. The ServiceSecurityContext property returns the security environment under which the method executes. The EndpointDispatcher property gets the operation's System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.EndpointDispatcher. The Extensions property returns an extension collection for the current OperationContext. The Host property returns the ServiceHostBase object that manages the service. The HasSupportingTokens property returns a value that indicates whether the method has supporting tokens, if so, the SupportingTokens property gets them. The IncomingMessageHeaders, IncomingMessageProperties, and IncomingMessageVersion properties get these items from the incoming message. The OperationCompleted event is fired when the operation has completed. The OutgoingMessageHeaders and OutgoingMessageProperties properties get these items for the outbound message. The RequestContext property returns the RequestContext implementation for the method. The InstanceContext property returns the InstanceContext associated with the operation. The SessionId property returns the session identifier for the current channel and object. The GetCallbackChannel(Of T) method returns a callback channel to the caller in the case of duplex communication. The SetTransactionComplete method commits the current transaction.
Example: The following code example uses the Current property and GetCallbackChannel(Of T) method to obtain the channel back to the caller from within a method. All methods in this example are one-way methods, enabling the service and the client to communicate in both directions independently. In this case, the example client application expects only one return call before it exits, but an client, for example a Windows Forms client, can receive any number of calls from the service.  The following client implements the SampleDuplexHelloCallback to receive the callback message. The imported callback contract is not the same name as the one in the service, due to the use of the Name property in the preceding example. Note that the client makes no assumptions about whether or when it might receive a callback; the server callback is entirely independent of the client's outbound call. Note For an example that uses the OperationContext class in a client scenario, see OperationContextScope.

34307,473421,477165,8,"@Retention(value=RUNTIME) @Target(value={FIELD,METHOD}) public @interface XmlElementRef ","Maps a JavaBean property to a XML element derived from property's type.

Usage

@XmlElementRef annotation can be used with a JavaBean property or from 
within XmlElementRefs

This annotation dynamically associates an XML element name with the 
JavaBean property. When a JavaBean property is annotated with XmlElement, 
the XML element name is statically derived from the JavaBean property name. 
However, when this annotation is used, the XML element name is derived from 
the instance of the type of the JavaBean property at runtime.


XML Schema substitution group support

XML Schema allows a XML document author to use XML element names that were 
not statically specified in the content model of a schema using 
substitution groups. Schema derived code provides support for substitution 
groups using an element property, (section 5.5.5, Element Property of 
JAXB 2.0 specification). An element property method signature is of the 
form:

 public void setTerm(JAXBElement<? extends Operator>); public JAXBElement<? extends Operator> getTerm(); 

An element factory method annotated with XmlElementDecl is used to create a 
JAXBElement instance, containing an XML element name. The presence of 
@XmlElementRef annotation on an element property indicates that the element 
name from JAXBElement instance be used instead of deriving an XML element 
name from the JavaBean property name.

The usage is subject to the following constraints:

    * If the collection item type (for collection property) or property
      type (for single valued property) is JAXBElement, then 
      @XmlElementRef}.name() and @XmlElementRef.namespace() must point an
      element factory method with an @XmlElementDecl annotation in a class
      annotated with @XmlRegistry (usually ObjectFactory class generated by
      the schema compiler) :
          o @XmlElementDecl.name() must equal @XmlElementRef.name()
          o @XmlElementDecl.namespace() must equal
            @XmlElementRef.namespace().
    * If the collection item type (for collection property) or property
      type (for single valued property) is not JAXBElement, then the type
      referenced by the property or field must be annotated with 
      XmlRootElement.
    * This annotation can be used with the following annotations: 
      XmlElementWrapper, XmlJavaTypeAdapter.

See Package Specification in javax.xml.bind.package javadoc for 
additional common information.

Example 1: Ant Task Example

The following Java class hierarchy models an Ant build script. An Ant task 
corresponds to a class in the class hierarchy. The XML element name of an 
Ant task is indicated by the @XmlRootElement annotation on its 
corresponding class.

 @XmlRootElement(name=target) class Target { // The presence of @XmlElementRef indicates that the XML // element name will be derived from the @XmlRootElement // annotation on the type (for e.g. jar for JarTask). @XmlElementRef List<Task> tasks; }  abstract class Task { }  @XmlRootElement(name=jar) class JarTask extends Task { ... }  @XmlRootElement(name=javac) class JavacTask extends Task { ... }  <!-- XML Schema fragment --> <xs:element name=target type=Target> <xs:complexType name=Target> <xs:sequence> <xs:choice maxOccurs=unbounded> <xs:element ref=jar> <xs:element ref=javac> </xs:choice> </xs:sequence> </xs:complexType>  

Thus the following code fragment:

 Target target = new Target(); target.tasks.add(new JarTask()); target.tasks.add(new JavacTask()); marshal(target); 

will produce the following XML output:

   ....   ....   

It is not an error to have a class that extends Task that doesn't have 
XmlRootElement. But they can't show up in an XML instance (because they 
don't have XML element names).

Example 2: XML Schema Susbstitution group support

The following example shows the annotations for XML Schema substitution 
groups. The annotations and the ObjectFactory are derived from the schema.

 @XmlElement class Math { //  The value of type()is //  JAXBElement.class , which indicates the XML //  element name ObjectFactory - in general a class marked //  with @XmlRegistry. (See ObjectFactory below) // //  The name() is operator, a pointer to a // factory method annotated with a //  XmlElementDecl with the name operator. Since //  operator is the head of a substitution group that //  contains elements add and sub elements, operator //  element can be substituted in an instance document by //  elements add or sub. At runtime, JAXBElement //  instance contains the element name that has been //  substituted in the XML document. // @XmlElementRef(type=JAXBElement.class,name=operator) JAXBElement<? extends Operator> term; }  @XmlRegistry class ObjectFactory { @XmlElementDecl(name=operator) JAXBElement<Operator> createOperator(Operator o) {...} @XmlElementDecl(name=add,substitutionHeadName=operator) JAXBElement<Operator> createAdd(Operator o) {...} @XmlElementDecl(name=sub,substitutionHeadName=operator) JAXBElement<Operator> createSub(Operator o) {...} }  class Operator { ... } 

Thus, the following code fragment

 Math m = new Math(); m.term = new ObjectFactory().createAdd(new Operator()); marshal(m); 

will produce the following XML output:

 <math> <add>...</add> </math> 

Since:
    JAXB2.0

    This parameter and name() are used to determine the XML element for the

    If type() is JAXBElement.class , then namespace() and name() point to a
    factory method with XmlElementDecl. The XML element name is the element
    name from the factory method's XmlElementDecl annotation or if an
    element from its substitution group (of which it is a head element) has
    been substituted in the XML document, then the element name is from the 
    XmlElementDecl on the substituted element.

    If type() is not JAXBElement.class, then the XML element name is the
    XML element name statically associated with the type using the
    annotation XmlRootElement on the type. If the type is not annotated
    with an XmlElementDecl, then it is an error.

    If type() is not JAXBElement.class, then this value must be .

It also contains supporting types that help during the management of health events. ASP.NET raises events of type WebViewStateFailureAuditEvent when a view-state failure occurs. This failure indicates either an attempt to tamper with view state or its reuse from another machine with a different key. The related audit event code is AuditInvalidViewStateFailure. Note In most cases you will be able to use the ASP.NET health-monitoring types as implemented, and you will control the health-monitoring system by specifying values in the healthMonitoring configuration section. You can also derive from the health-monitoring types to create your own custom events and providers.

rectangular area. All coordinates that lie inside the rectangular area
must lie within the Shape for the entire rectanglar area to be
considered contained within the Shape.

The Shape.contains() method allows a Shape implementation to
conservatively return false when:

* the intersect method returns true and
* the calculations to determine whether or not the Shape entirely
contains the rectangular area are prohibitively expensive.
This means that for some Shapes this method might return false even
though the Shape contains the rectangular area. The Area class performs
more accurate geometric computations than most Shape objects and
therefore can be used if a more precise answer is required.

This method object may conservatively return false in cases where the
specified rectangular area intersects a segment of the path, but that
segment does not represent a boundary between the interior and exterior
of the path. Such segments could lie entirely within the interior of
the path if they are part of a path with a WIND_NON_ZERO winding rule
or if the segments are retraced in the reverse direction such that the
two sets of segments cancel each other out without any exterior area
falling between them. To determine whether segments represent true
boundaries of the interior of the path would require extensive
calculations involving all of the segments of the path and the winding
rule and are thus beyond the scope of this implementation.

Syntax: public event DataGridViewCellParsingEventHandler CellParsing
Summary: Occurs when a cell leaves edit mode if the cell value has been modified.
Remarks: By default, the DataGridView control will attempt to convert a user-specified value displayed in a cell to an actual underlying cell value in the type specified by the cell ValueType property. This conversion uses the formatting properties of the cell style returned by the cell InheritedStyle property. If the standard conversion does not meet your needs, handle the CellParsing event to provide custom value conversion to the required type. Users can enter edit mode using the method specified by the EditMode property, and can leave edit mode, committing any changes to a cell, by moving to another cell or by pressing ENTER. Pressing ESC will revert any changes to the value before it is committed, and the CellParsing event will not occur. The CellParsing event occurs only if the cell value has actually been modified, even if the final value is the same as the original value. It also occurs when the CommitEdit method is called. When you handle the CellParsing event, you can convert the value yourself or you can customize the default conversion. For example, you can convert the value yourself using the cell ParseFormattedValue method with type converters of your choosing. Alternatively, you can let the default type converters parse the value, but modify the NullValue, DataSourceNullValue, and FormatProvider properties of the object returned by the DataGridViewCellParsingEventArgs.InheritedCellStyle property, which is initialized using the cell InheritedStyle property. When you convert the value yourself, replace the initial, formatted value of the ConvertEventArgs.Value property with the converted value in the type specified by the cell ValueType property. To indicate that no further parsing is necessary, set the DataGridViewCellParsingEventArgs.ParsingApplied property to true. When the event handler completes, if the ConvertEventArgs.Value is Nothing or is not of the correct type, or the DataGridViewCellParsingEventArgs.ParsingApplied property is false, the Value is parsed using the cell ParseFormattedValue method with default type converters. The default implementation of this method parses the value using the NullValue, DataSourceNullValue, and FormatProvider properties of the cell style passed in. If the value is not equal to NullValue, the value is parsed using the FormatProvider property and the type converters passed in. To customize the conversion of a cell value into a formatted value for display, handle the CellFormatting event. For more information about handling events, see Consuming Events.

Syntax: public static class SessionStateUtility
Summary: Provides helper methods used by session-state modules and session-state store providers to manage session information for an ASP.NET application. This class cannot be inherited.
Remarks: The SessionStateUtility class provides static helper methods that are used by a session-state module or a session-state store provider. Application developers will not need to call these methods from their code. The following table describes the ways the session-state module and session-state store provider use the methods. Method Use GetHttpSessionStateFromContext method Can be used by custom session-state modules to either retrieve session information for an existing session or create session information for a new session. AddHttpSessionStateToContext method Called by the session-state module to add the session data to the current HttpContext and make it available to application code through the Session property. RemoveHttpSessionStateFromContext method Called by the session-state module during the ReleaseRequestState or EndRequest events at the end of a request, to clear session data from the current HttpContext. GetSessionStaticObjects method Called by the session-state module to get a reference to the StaticObjects collection based on objects defined in the Global.asax file. The HttpStaticObjectsCollection collection returned is included with the session data added to the current HttpContext. Session data is passed to and retrieved from the current HttpContext as an HttpSessionStateContainer object or any valid implementation of the IHttpSessionState interface. For information about implementing a session-state store provider, see Implementing a Session-State Store Provider.
Example: The following code example shows a custom session-state module implementation that stores session information in memory using a Hashtable. The module uses the SessionStateUtility class to reference the current HttpContext and SessionIDManager, retrieve the current HttpStaticObjectsCollection, and raise the Session_OnEnd event defined in the Global.asax file for the ASP.NET application. This application does not prevent simultaneous Web requests from using the same session identifier.  To use this custom session-state module in an ASP.NET application, you can replace the existing SessionStateModule reference in the Web.config file, as shown in the following example.

Syntax: public class WebApplicationLifetimeEvent : WebManagementEvent
Summary: Represents a significant event in the lifetime of an application.
Remarks: ASP.NET health monitoring allows production and operations staff to manage deployed Web applications. The System.Web.Management namespace contains the health-event types responsible for packaging application health-status data and the provider types responsible for processing this data. It also contains supporting types that help during the management of health events. Application lifetime events include events such as application startup and shutdown events. If an application is terminated, you can determine why by viewing the related event message field. When a WebApplicationLifetimeEvent instance occurs, ASP.NET health monitoring updates the Application Lifetime Events performance counter. You can log these events by adding the WebApplicationLifetimeEvent object to the rules subsection of the healthMonitoring section of the configuration file, as shown in the following example.  The Application Lifetime Events performance counter contains the sum total of all ASP.NET lifetime events. To view this performance counter in System Monitor (PerfMon), in the Add Counters window select ASP.NET from the Performance object drop-down list. Select the Application Lifetime Events performance counter, and click the Add button. For more information, see #Using the System Monitor (PerfMon) with ASP.NET Applications# on MSDN. If you allow events to be logged by the standard EventLogWebEventProvider, you can view them in Event Viewer by selecting the Application log. For more information, see Event Viewer in the Windows Server 2003 documentation on TechNet. Caution Because the WebApplicationLifetimeEvent object is a high-volume event, logging it is resource-intensive and might slow down your system. It can also cause  events to be overwritten in the case of the EventLogWebEventProvider class due to the high volume of events and the way the event logging works. Note In most cases you will be able to use the ASP.NET health-monitoring types as implemented, and you will control the health-monitoring system by specifying values in the healthMonitoring configuration section. You can also derive from the health-monitoring types to create your own custom events and providers. For an example of deriving from the WebApplicationLifetimeEvent class, see the example provided in this topic. Notes to Inheritors When formatting your custom event information for display, override the FormatCustomEventDetails method rather than the ToString method. This will avoid overwriting or tampering with sensitive system information.
Example: The following code example shows how to derive from the WebApplicationLifetimeEvent class to create a custom event.  The following configuration-file excerpt shows how to configure the healthMonitoring section of a configuration file to add the SampleWebApplicationLifetimeEvent code defined above to the ASP.NET health-monitoring system. To add the event to the system, you must define the event by adding a new entry to the eventMappings section and map the event to a provider by adding a new entry to the rules section.

expected concurrency for updates. This class obeys the same functional 
specification as Hashtable, and includes versions of methods corresponding 
to each method of Hashtable. However, even though all operations are 
thread-safe, retrieval operations do not entail locking, and there is not 
any support for locking the entire table in a way that prevents all access. 
This class is fully interoperable with Hashtable in programs that rely on 
its thread safety but not on its synchronization details.

Retrieval operations (including get) generally do not block, so may overlap 
with update operations (including put and remove). Retrievals reflect the 
results of the most recently completed update operations holding upon their 
onset. For aggregate operations such as putAll and clear, concurrent 
retrievals may reflect insertion or removal of only some entries. 
Similarly, Iterators and Enumerations return elements reflecting the state 
of the hash table at some point at or since the creation of the 
iterator/enumeration. They do not throw ConcurrentModificationException. 
However, iterators are designed to be used by only one thread at a time.

The allowed concurrency among update operations is guided by the optional 
concurrencyLevel constructor argument (default 16), which is used as a hint 
for internal sizing. The table is internally partitioned to try to permit 
the indicated number of concurrent updates without contention. Because 
placement in hash tables is essentially random, the actual concurrency will 
vary. Ideally, you should choose a value to accommodate as many threads as 
will ever concurrently modify the table. Using a significantly higher value 
than you need can waste space and time, and a significantly lower value can 
lead to thread contention. But overestimates and underestimates within an 
order of magnitude do not usually have much noticeable impact. A value of 
one is appropriate when it is known that only one thread will modify and 
all others will only read. Also, resizing this or any other kind of hash 
table is a relatively slow operation, so, when possible, it is a good idea 
to provide estimates of expected table sizes in constructors.

This class and its views and iterators implement all of the optional 
methods of the Map and Iterator interfaces.

Like Hashtable but unlike HashMap, this class does not allow null to be

32663,448256,452000,8,public class ChoiceFormat   ,"A ChoiceFormat allows you to attach a format to a range of numbers. It is 
generally used in a MessageFormat for handling plurals. The choice is 
specified with an ascending list of doubles, where each item specifies a 
half-open interval up to the next item:

     X matches j if and only if limit[j] <= X < limit[j+1] 

If there is no match, then either the first or last index is used, 
depending on whether the number (X) is too low or too high. If the limit 
array is not in ascending order, the results of formatting will be 
incorrect. ChoiceFormat also accepts  u221E as equivalent to infinity(INF).

Note: ChoiceFormat differs from the other Format classes in that you create 
a ChoiceFormat object with a constructor (not with a getInstance style 
factory method). The factory methods aren't necessary because ChoiceFormat 
doesn't require any complex setup for a given locale. In fact, 
ChoiceFormat doesn't implement any locale specific behavior.

When creating a ChoiceFormat, you must specify an array of formats and an 
array of limits. The length of these arrays must be the same. For example,

    * limits = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
      formats = {Sun,Mon,Tue,Wed,Thur,Fri,Sat}
    * limits = {0, 1, ChoiceFormat.nextDouble(1)}
      formats = {no files, one file, many files}
      (nextDouble can be used to get the next higher double, to make the
      half-open interval.)

Here is a simple example that shows formatting and parsing:

     double[] limits = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}; String[] dayOfWeekNames = {Sun,Mon,Tue,Wed,Thur,Fri,Sat}; ChoiceFormat form = new ChoiceFormat(limits, dayOfWeekNames); ParsePosition status = new ParsePosition(0); for (double i = 0.0; i <= 8.0; ++i) { status.setIndex(0); System.out.println(i +  ->  + form.format(i) +  ->  + form.parse(form.format(i),status)); } 

Here is a more complex example, with a pattern format:

     double[] filelimits = {0,1,2}; String[] filepart = {are no files,is one file,are {2} files}; ChoiceFormat fileform = new ChoiceFormat(filelimits, filepart); Format[] testFormats = {fileform, null, NumberFormat.getInstance()}; MessageFormat pattform = new MessageFormat(There {0} on {1}); pattform.setFormats(testFormats); Object[] testArgs = {null, ADisk, null}; for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) { testArgs[0] = new Integer(i); testArgs[2] = testArgs[0]; System.out.println(pattform.format(testArgs)); } 

Specifying a pattern for ChoiceFormat objects is fairly straightforward. 
For example:

     ChoiceFormat fmt = new ChoiceFormat( -1\#is negative| 0\#is zero or fraction | 1\#is one |1.0<is 1+ |2\#is two |2<is more than 2.); System.out.println(Formatter Pattern :  + fmt.toPattern());  System.out.println(Format with -INF :  + fmt.format(Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY)); System.out.println(Format with -1.0 :  + fmt.format(-1.0)); System.out.println(Format with 0 :  + fmt.format(0)); System.out.println(Format with 0.9 :  + fmt.format(0.9)); System.out.println(Format with 1.0 :  + fmt.format(1)); System.out.println(Format with 1.5 :  + fmt.format(1.5)); System.out.println(Format with 2 :  + fmt.format(2)); System.out.println(Format with 2.1 :  + fmt.format(2.1)); System.out.println(Format with NaN :  + fmt.format(Double.NaN)); System.out.println(Format with +INF :  + fmt.format(Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY)); 

And the output result would be like the following:

 

     Format with -INF : is negative Format with -1.0 : is negative Format with 0 : is zero or fraction Format with 0.9 : is zero or fraction Format with 1.0 : is one Format with 1.5 : is 1+ Format with 2 : is two Format with 2.1 : is more than 2. Format with NaN : is negative Format with +INF : is more than 2. 


Synchronization

Choice formats are not synchronized. It is recommended to create separate 
format instances for each thread. If multiple threads access a format 
concurrently, it must be synchronized externally.

for decoding a String from the application/x-www-form-urlencoded MIME 
format.

To conversion process is the reverse of that used by the URLEncoder class. 
It is assumed that all characters in the encoded string are one of the 
following: a through z, A through Z, 0 through 9, and -, _
, ., and *. The character % is allowed but is interpreted as the 
start of a special escaped sequence.

The following rules are applied in the conversion:

    * The alphanumeric characters a through z, A through Z and 0
      through 9 remain the same.
    * The special characters ., -, *, and _ remain the same.
    * The plus sign + is converted into a space character   .
    * A sequence of the form %xy will be treated as representing a byte
      where xy is the two-digit hexadecimal representation of the 8 bits.
      Then, all substrings that contain one or more of these byte sequences
      consecutively will be replaced by the character(s) whose encoding
      would result in those consecutive bytes. The encoding scheme used to
      decode these characters may be specified, or if unspecified, the
      default encoding of the platform will be used.

There are two possible ways in which this decoder could deal with illegal 
strings. It could either leave illegal characters alone or it could throw 
an IllegalArgumentException. Which approach the decoder takes is left to

    1.2","Utility class for HTML form decoding. This class contains static methods  for decoding a String from the application/x-www-form-urlencoded MIME  format.  To conversion process is the reverse of that used by the URLEncoder class.  It is assumed that all characters in the encoded string are one of the  following: a through z, A through Z, 0 through 9, and -, _ , ., and *. The character % is allowed but is interpreted as the  start of a special escaped sequence.  The following rules are applied in the conversion:      * The alphanumeric characters a through z, A through Z and 0       through 9 remain the same.     * The special characters ., -, *, and _ remain the same.     * The plus sign + is converted into a space character   .     * A sequence of the form %xy will be treated as representing a byte       where xy is the two-digit hexadecimal representation of the 8 bits.       Then, all substrings that contain one or more of these byte sequences       consecutively will be replaced by the character(s) whose encoding       would result in those consecutive bytes. The encoding scheme used to       decode these characters may be specified, or if unspecified, the       default encoding of the platform will be used.  There are two possible ways in which this decoder could deal with illegal  strings. It could either leave illegal characters alone or it could throw  an IllegalArgumentException. Which approach the decoder takes is left to  the implementation.  Since:     1.2",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,227,clean,,,,,,

32558,446353,450097,8,public final class SignedObject   ,"SignedObject is a class for the purpose of creating authentic runtime 
objects whose integrity cannot be compromised without being detected.

More specifically, a SignedObject contains another Serializable object, the 
(to-be-)signed object and its signature.

The signed object is a deep copy (in serialized form) of an original 
object. Once the copy is made, further manipulation of the original object 
has no side effect on the copy.

The underlying signing algorithm is designated by the Signature object 
passed to the constructor and the verify method. A typical usage for 
signing is the following:

 Signature signingEngine = Signature.getInstance(algorithm, provider); SignedObject so = new SignedObject(myobject, signingKey, signingEngine); 

A typical usage for verification is the following (having received 
SignedObject so):

 Signature verificationEngine = Signature.getInstance(algorithm, provider); if (so.verify(publickey, verificationEngine)) try { Object myobj = so.getObject(); } catch (java.lang.ClassNotFoundException e) {}; 

Several points are worth noting. First, there is no need to initialize the 
signing or verification engine, as it will be re-initialized inside the 
constructor and the verify method. Secondly, for verification to succeed, 
the specified public key must be the public key corresponding to the 
private key used to generate the SignedObject.

More importantly, for flexibility reasons, the constructor and verify 
method allow for customized signature engines, which can implement 
signature algorithms that are not installed formally as part of a crypto 
provider. However, it is crucial that the programmer writing the verifier 
code be aware what Signature engine is being used, as its own 
implementation of the verify method is invoked to verify a signature. In 
other words, a malicious Signature may choose to always return true on 
verification in an attempt to bypass a security check.

The signature algorithm can be, among others, the NIST standard DSA, using 
DSA and SHA-1. The algorithm is specified using the same convention as that 
for signatures. The DSA algorithm using the SHA-1 message digest algorithm 
can be specified, for example, as SHA/DSA or SHA-1/DSA (they are 
equivalent). In the case of RSA, there are multiple choices for the message 
digest algorithm, so the signing algorithm could be specified as, for 
example, MD2/RSA, MD5/RSA or SHA-1/RSA. The algorithm name must be 
specified, as there is no default.

The name of the Cryptography Package Provider is designated also by the 
Signature parameter to the constructor and the verify method. If the 
provider is not specified, the default provider is used. Each installation 
can be configured to use a particular provider as default.

Potential applications of SignedObject include:

    * It can be used internally to any Java runtime as an unforgeable
      authorization token -- one that can be passed around without the fear
      that the token can be maliciously modified without being detected.
    * It can be used to sign and serialize data/object for storage outside
      the Java runtime (e.g., storing critical access control data on
      disk).
    * Nested SignedObjects can be used to construct a logical sequence of
      signatures, resembling a chain of authorization and delegation.

Syntax: [AttributeUsageAttribute(AttributeTargets.Method|AttributeTargets.Property|AttributeTargets.Field|AttributeTargets.Parameter, AllowMultiple = false)] public class DataTypeAttribute : ValidationAttribute
Summary: Specifies the name of an additional type to associate with a data field.
Remarks: The DataTypeAttribute attribute enables you to mark fields by using a type that is more specific than the database intrinsic type. The type name is selected from the DataType enumeration type. For example, a string data field that contains e-mail addresses can be specified as the EmailAddress type. This information is then accessed by the field templates to modify how the data field is processed. You use the DataTypeAttribute attribute for the following reasons: To provide additional type information for a data field. You do this by applying the DataTypeAttribute attribute to a data field in the data model and by specifying the additional type name from the DataType enumeration. The field template that processes the data field can access this additional metadata type information to determine how to process the field. For example, the text field template can generate hyperlinks for e-mail addresses whose intrinsic type is String. To associate a custom field template with a data field. The specified custom field template will then be used to process the data field. This is an alternative to using the UIHintAttribute attribute. When you apply the DataTypeAttribute attribute to a data field you must do the following: Follow the attribute usage rules. Implement the metadata class that contains the data fields to which you want to apply the attribute. Issue validation errors as appropriate. For more information, see ASP.NET Dynamic Data Guidelines. See a run-time code example of this feature: Run.
Example: The following example uses the DataTypeAttribute attribute to customize the display of the EmailAddress data field. The e-mail addresses are shown as hyperlinks instead of as simple text, which is what Dynamic Data would infer from the intrinsic data type. The example code is in three parts, and it performs the following steps: It implements a metadata partial class and the associated metadata class. In the associated metadata class, it applies the DataTypeAttribute attribute to the EmailAddress data field by specifying the EmailAddress enumerated value. This indicates to the Text.ascx field template that it should customize the display of e-mail addresses. It modifies the Text.ascx field template to customize the display of the EmailAddress data fields.    <%@ Control Language=## CodeFile=#Text.ascx.cs# Inherits=#TextField# %> <!-- Removed, evaluated in the code behind. <%\# FieldValueString %> -->    To compile and run the example code, you need the following: Visual Studio 2008 Service Pack 1 or Visual Developer 2008 Express Edition Service Pack 1.

If you install multiple instances of a service on computers throughout a forest, each instance must have its own SPN. A given service instance can have multiple SPNs if there are multiple names that clients might use for authentication. When a client wants to connect to a service, it locates an instance of the service, composes an SPN for that instance, and sets the identity to a SpnEndpointIdentity. A check will be made that the message is intended for that service. The three authentication modes used under Kerberos are: SSPINegotiate Kerberos KerberosOverTransport.

This feature is only useful with web services that have an associated WSDL. 
Enabling this feature requires that a JAX-WS implementation inspect the 
wsdl:binding for an endpoint at runtime to make sure that all 
wsdl:extensions that have the required attribute set to true are understood 
and are being used.

The following describes the affects of this feature with respect to be 
enabled or disabled:

    * ENABLED: In this Mode, a JAX-WS runtime MUST assure that all required 
      wsdl:binding extensions are either understood and used by the
      runtime, or explicitly disabled by the web service application. A web
      service application can disable a particular extension that has a
      known WebServiceFeature using either the appropriate annotation
      associated with that WebServiceFeature on the server, or one of the
      following methods on the client:
          o Service.getPort(QName,Class,WebServiceFeature...)
          o Service.getPort(Class,WebServiceFeature...)
          o Service.getPort(EndpointReference,Class,WebServiceFeature...)

          o EndpointReference.getPort(Class,WebServiceFeature...)
          o One of the getXXXPort(WebServiceFeatures...) methods on a
            generated Service.
      The runtime MUST also make sure that binding of SEI parameters/return
      values respect the wsdl:binding. With this feature enabled, if a
      required (wsdl:required=true) wsdl:binding extension is in the WSDL
      and it is not supported by a JAX-WS runtime and it has not been
      explicitly turned off by the web service developer, then that JAX-WS
      runtime MUST behave appropriately based on whether it is on the
      client or server:
          o Client: runtime MUST throw a WebServiceException no sooner than
            when one of the methods above is invoked but no later than the
            first invocation of an endpoint operation.
          o Server: throw a WebServiceException and the endpoint MUST fail
            to deploy
    * DISABLED: In this Mode, an implementation may choose whether to
      inspect the wsdl:binding or not and to what degree the wsdl:binding 
      will be inspected. For example, one implementation may choose to
      behave as if this feature is enabled, another implementation may only

object represents. An alternative to the DriverManager facility, a 
DataSource object is the preferred means of getting a connection. An object 
that implements the DataSource interface will typically be registered with 
a naming service based on the JavaTM Naming and Directory (JNDI) API.

The DataSource interface is implemented by a driver vendor. There are three 
types of implementations:

   1. Basic implementation -- produces a standard Connection object
   2. Connection pooling implementation -- produces a Connection object
      that will automatically participate in connection pooling. This
      implementation works with a middle-tier connection pooling manager.
   3. Distributed transaction implementation -- produces a Connection 
      object that may be used for distributed transactions and almost
      always participates in connection pooling. This implementation works
      with a middle-tier transaction manager and almost always with a
      connection pooling manager.

A DataSource object has properties that can be modified when necessary. For 
example, if the data source is moved to a different server, the property 
for the server can be changed. The benefit is that because the data 
source's properties can be changed, any code accessing that data source 
does not need to be changed.

A driver that is accessed via a DataSource object does not register itself 
with the DriverManager. Rather, a DataSource object is retrieved though a 
lookup operation and then used to create a Connection object. With a basic 
implementation, the connection obtained through a DataSource object is 
identical to a connection obtained through the DriverManager facility.

34752,459077,462821,8,public interface LoginModule ,"LoginModule describes the interface implemented by authentication 
technology providers. LoginModules are plugged in under applications to 
provide a particular type of authentication.

While applications write to the LoginContext API, authentication technology 
providers implement the LoginModule interface. A Configuration specifies 
the LoginModule(s) to be used with a particular login application. 
Therefore different LoginModules can be plugged in under the application 
without requiring any modifications to the application itself.

The LoginContext is responsible for reading the Configuration and 
instantiating the appropriate LoginModules. Each LoginModule is initialized 
with a Subject, a CallbackHandler, shared LoginModule state, and 
LoginModule-specific options. The Subject represents the Subject currently 
being authenticated and is updated with relevant Credentials if 
authentication succeeds. LoginModules use the CallbackHandler to 
communicate with users. The CallbackHandler may be used to prompt for 
usernames and passwords, for example. Note that the CallbackHandler may be 
null. LoginModules which absolutely require a CallbackHandler to 
authenticate the Subject may throw a LoginException. LoginModules 
optionally use the shared state to share information or data among 
themselves.

The LoginModule-specific options represent the options configured for this 
LoginModule by an administrator or user in the login Configuration. The 
options are defined by the LoginModule itself and control the behavior 
within it. For example, a LoginModule may define options to support 
debugging/testing capabilities. Options are defined using a key-value 
syntax, such as debug=true. The LoginModule stores the options as a Map so 
that the values may be retrieved using the key. Note that there is no limit 
to the number of options a LoginModule chooses to define.

The calling application sees the authentication process as a single 
operation. However, the authentication process within the LoginModule 
proceeds in two distinct phases. In the first phase, the LoginModule's 
login method gets invoked by the LoginContext's login method. The login 
method for the LoginModule then performs the actual authentication (prompt 
for and verify a password for example) and saves its authentication status 
as private state information. Once finished, the LoginModule's login 
method either returns true (if it succeeded) or false (if it should be 
ignored), or throws a LoginException to specify a failure. In the failure 
case, the LoginModule must not retry the authentication or introduce 
delays. The responsibility of such tasks belongs to the application. If the 
application attempts to retry the authentication, the LoginModule's login 
method will be called again.

In the second phase, if the LoginContext's overall authentication succeeded 
(the relevant REQUIRED, REQUISITE, SUFFICIENT and OPTIONAL LoginModules 
succeeded), then the commit method for the LoginModule gets invoked. The 
commit method for a LoginModule checks its privately saved state to see if 
its own authentication succeeded. If the overall LoginContext 
authentication succeeded and the LoginModule's own authentication 
succeeded, then the commit method associates the relevant Principals 
(authenticated identities) and Credentials (authentication data such as 
cryptographic keys) with the Subject located within the LoginModule.

If the LoginContext's overall authentication failed (the relevant REQUIRED, 
REQUISITE, SUFFICIENT and OPTIONAL LoginModules did not succeed), then the 
abort method for each LoginModule gets invoked. In this case, the 
LoginModule removes/destroys any authentication state originally saved.

Logging out a Subject involves only one phase. The LoginContext invokes the 
LoginModule's logout method. The logout method for the LoginModule then 
performs the logout procedures, such as removing Principals or Credentials 
from the Subject or logging session information.

A LoginModule implementation must have a constructor with no arguments. 
This allows classes which load the LoginModule to instantiate it.

already been defined by the class loader, then the existing proxy class

There are several restrictions on the parameters that may be passed to
Proxy.getProxyClass:

* All of the Class objects in the interfaces array must represent
interfaces, not classes or primitive types.
* No two elements in the interfaces array may refer to identical
Class objects.
* All of the interface types must be visible by name through the
specified class loader. In other words, for class loader cl and
every interface i, the following expression must be true:

Class.forName(i.getName(), false, cl) == i

* All non-public interfaces must be in the same package; otherwise,
it would not be possible for the proxy class to implement all of
the interfaces, regardless of what package it is defined in.
* For any set of member methods of the specified interfaces that
have the same signature:
o If the return type of any of the methods is a primitive
type or void, then all of the methods must have that same
return type.
o Otherwise, one of the methods must have a return type that
is assignable to all of the return types of the rest of the
methods.
* The resulting proxy class must not exceed any limits imposed on
classes by the virtual machine. For example, the VM may limit the
number of interfaces that a class may implement to 65535; in that
case, the size of the interfaces array must not exceed 65535.

If any of these restrictions are violated, Proxy.getProxyClass will
throw an IllegalArgumentException. If the interfaces array argument or

Note that the order of the specified proxy interfaces is significant:
two requests for a proxy class with the same combination of interfaces

32565,446161,449905,8,public abstract class PermissionCollection   ,"Abstract class representing a collection of Permission objects.

With a PermissionCollection, you can:

    * add a permission to the collection using the add method.
    * check to see if a particular permission is implied in the collection,
      using the implies method.
    * enumerate all the permissions, using the elements method.

When it is desirable to group together a number of Permission objects of 
the same type, the newPermissionCollection method on that particular type 
of Permission object should first be called. The default behavior (from the 
Permission class) is to simply return null. Subclasses of class Permission 
override the method if they need to store their permissions in a particular 
PermissionCollection object in order to provide the correct semantics when 
the PermissionCollection.implies method is called. If a non-null value is 
returned, that PermissionCollection must be used. If null is returned, then 
the caller of newPermissionCollection is free to store permissions of the 
given type in any PermissionCollection they choose (one that uses a 
Hashtable, one that uses a Vector, etc).

The PermissionCollection returned by the 
Permission.newPermissionCollection method is a homogeneous collection, 
which stores only Permission objects for a given Permission type. A 
PermissionCollection may also be heterogeneous. For example, Permissions is 
a PermissionCollection subclass that represents a collection of 
PermissionCollections. That is, its members are each a homogeneous 
PermissionCollection. For example, a Permissions object might have a 
FilePermissionCollection for all the FilePermission objects, a 
SocketPermissionCollection for all the SocketPermission objects, and so on. 
Its add method adds a permission to the appropriate collection.

Whenever a permission is added to a heterogeneous PermissionCollection such 
as Permissions, and the PermissionCollection doesn't yet contain a 
PermissionCollection of the specified permission's type, the 
PermissionCollection should call the newPermissionCollection method on the 
permission's class to see if it requires a special PermissionCollection. If 
newPermissionCollection returns null, the PermissionCollection is free to 
store the permission in any type of PermissionCollection it desires (one 
using a Hashtable, one using a Vector, etc.). For example, the Permissions 
object uses a default PermissionCollection implementation that stores the 
permission objects in a Hashtable.

Subclass implementations of PermissionCollection should assume that they 
may be called simultaneously from multiple threads, and therefore should be 
synchronized properly. Furthermore, Enumerations returned via the elements 
method are not fail-fast. Modifications to a collection should not be 
performed while enumerating over that collection.

Remarks: You can use the methods of this class to programmatically enable and disable a SQL Server database and its tables for SqlCacheDependency object change notifications.

However, you can also use the Aspnet_regsql command-line tool to manage change notifications for a SQL Server database and its tables.

For more information on how to set permissions on a database, see the SQL Server documentation. For more information about the account used by the ASP.NET process, see ASP.NET Impersonation.
Example: The following code example is a simple ASP.NET page for enabling and disabling change notifications on SQL Server database tables. It uses the SqlCacheDependencyAdmin object to manage change notifications in the database specified in a connection string called MyConnectionString. The example includes two files, an .aspx file that defines the user interface and a code-behind file containing the source code for the ASP.NET events.

Syntax: public abstract class WorkflowRuntimeService
Summary: The abstract base class from which the workflow runtime engine core services are derived.
Remarks: Services that derive from the WorkflowRuntimeService class can be started and stopped by the workflow runtime engine. The order in which the services are started or stopped, however, is indeterminate, and services may require the support of other services in order to properly initialize themselves when they are started, and, conversely, may require the to support of other services in order to properly shut down when they are stopped. To address this problem, the workflow runtime engine provides two-phase mechanisms for starting and stopping services. When StartRuntime is called, the workflow runtime engine invokes the Start method for each of its services that derive from the WorkflowRuntimeService class. After all of these services have been started, the workflow runtime engine raises the WorkflowRuntime.Started event, which causes the OnStarted method to be invoked for each workflow runtime engine service. Your service can override the OnStarted method to participate in this two phase process. Similarly, when StopRuntime is called, the Stop method, the WorkflowRuntime.Stopped event, and the OnStopped method provide this two-phase mechanism. The State property contains a WorkflowRuntimeServiceState value that indicates whether the service is in the process of starting or stopping or is completely started or stopped. Services that derive from the WorkflowRuntimeService class can raise the WorkflowRuntime.ServicesExceptionNotHandled event when they encounter a condition that causes an unhandled exception by calling RaiseServicesExceptionNotHandledEvent. Services derived from the WorkflowSchedulerService class, the WorkflowCommitWorkBatchService class, the WorkflowPersistenceService class, and the TrackingService class ultimately derives from the WorkflowRuntimeService class.

33727,464533,468277,8,"public abstract class RowFilter<M,I>   ","RowFilter is used to filter out entries from the model so that they are not 
shown in the view. For example, a RowFilter associated with a JTable might 
only allow rows that contain a column with a specific string. The meaning 
of entry depends on the component type. For example, when a filter is 
associated with a JTable, an entry corresponds to a row; when associated 
with a JTree, an entry corresponds to a node.

Subclasses must override the include method to indicate whether the entry 
should be shown in the view. The Entry argument can be used to obtain the 
values in each of the columns in that entry. The following example shows an 
include method that allows only entries containing one or more values 
starting with the string a:

 RowFilter<Object,Object> startsWithAFilter = new RowFilter<Object,Object>() { public boolean include(Entry<? extends Object, ? extends Object> entry) { for (int i = entry.getValueCount() - 1; i >= 0; i--) { if (entry.getStringValue(i).startsWith(a)) { // The value starts with a, include it return true; } } // None of the columns start with a; return false so that this // entry is not shown return false; } }; 

RowFilter has two formal type parameters that allow you to create a 
RowFilter for a specific model. For example, the following assumes a 
specific model that is wrapping objects of type Person. Only Persons with 
an age over 20 will be shown:

 RowFilter<PersonModel,Integer> ageFilter = new RowFilter<PersonModel,Integer>() { public boolean include(Entry<? extends PersonModel, ? extends Integer> entry) { PersonModel personModel = entry.getModel(); Person person = personModel.getPerson(entry.getIdentifier()); if (person.getAge() > 20) { // Returning true indicates this row should be shown. return true; } // Age is <= 20, don't show it. return false; } }; PersonModel model = createPersonModel(); TableRowSorter<PersonModel> sorter = new TableRowSorter<PersonModel>(model); sorter.setRowFilter(ageFilter);

addition, if the Converter class wishes to have configuration property 
values saved and restored with the component tree, the implementation must 
also implement StateHolder.

Starting with version 1.2 of the specification, an exception to the above 
zero-arguments constructor requirement has been introduced. If a converter 
has a single argument constructor that takes a Class instance and the 
Class of the data to be converted is known at converter instantiation time, 
this constructor must be used to instantiate the converter instead of the 
zero-argument version. This enables the per-class conversion of Java 
enumerated types.

If any Converter implementation requires a java.util.Locale to perform its 
job, it must obtain that Locale from the UIViewRoot of the current 
FacesContext, unless the Converter maintains its own Locale as part of its 
state.

If the class implementing Converter has a ResourceDependency annotation, 
the action described in ResourceDependency must be taken when 
ValueHolder.setConverter(javax.faces.convert.Converter) is called. If the 
class implementing Converter has a ResourceDependencies annotation, the 
action described in ResourceDependencies must be taken when

specified function on an underlying EIS.

The CCI specification defines a set of standard properties for an 
InteractionSpec. An InteractionSpec implementation is not required to 
support a standard property if that property does not apply to its 
underlying EIS.

The InteractionSpec implementation class must provide getter and setter 
methods for each of its supported properties. The getter and setter methods 
convention should be based on the Java Beans design pattern.

The standard properties are as follows:

    * FunctionName: name of an EIS function
    * InteractionVerb: mode of interaction with an EIS instance: SYNC_SEND,
      SYNC_SEND_RECEIVE, SYNC_RECEIVE
    * ExecutionTimeout: the number of milliseconds an Interaction will wait
      for an EIS to execute the specified function

The following standard properties are used to give hints to an Interaction 
instance about the ResultSet requirements:

    * FetchSize
    * FetchDirection
    * MaxFieldSize
    * ResultSetType
    * ResultSetConcurrency

A CCI implementation can provide additional properties beyond that 
described in the InteractionSpec interface. Note that the format and type 
of the additional properties is specific to an EIS and is outside the scope 
of the CCI specification.

It is required that the InteractionSpec interface be implemented as a 
JavaBean for the toolability support. The properties on the InteractionSpec 
implementation class should be defined through the getter and setter 
methods pattern. An implementation class for InteractionSpec interface is 
required to implement the java.io.Serializable interface.

<asp:UpdatePanel />
Summary: Enables sections of a page to be partially rendered without a postback.
Remarks: In this topic: Introduction Refreshing UpdatePanel Content UpdatePanel Usage Applying Styles Declarative Syntax Introduction UpdatePanel controls are a central part of AJAX functionality in ASP.NET. They are used with the ScriptManager control to enable partial-page rendering. Partial-page rendering reduces the need for synchronous postbacks and complete page updates when only part of the page has to be updated. Partial-page rendering improves the user experience because it reduces the screen flicker that occurs during a full-page postback and improves Web page interactivity. Refreshing UpdatePanel Content When partial-page rendering is enabled, a control can perform a postback that updates the whole page or an asynchronous postback that updates the content of one or more UpdatePanel controls. Whether a control causes an asynchronous postback and updates an UpdatePanel control depends on the following: If the UpdateMode property of the UpdatePanel control is set to Always, the UpdatePanel control's content is updated on every postback that originates from the page. This includes asynchronous postbacks from controls that are inside  UpdatePanel controls and postbacks from controls that are not inside UpdatePanel controls. If the UpdateMode property is set to Conditional, the UpdatePanel control's content is updated in the following circumstances: When you call the Update method of the UpdatePanel control explicitly. When the UpdatePanel control is nested inside an UpdatePanel control, and the parent panel is updated. When a postback is caused by a control that is defined as a trigger by using the Triggers property of the UpdatePanel control. In this scenario, the control explicitly triggers an update of the panel content. The control can be either inside or outside the UpdatePanel control that the trigger is associated with. When the ChildrenAsTriggers property is set to true and a child control of the UpdatePanel control causes a postback. Child controls of nested UpdatePanel controls do not cause an update to the outer UpdatePanel control unless they are explicitly defined as triggers. The combination of setting the ChildrenAsTriggers property to false and the UpdateMode property to Always is not allowed and will throw an exception. When the UpdatePanel control performs an asynchronous post, it adds a custom HTTP header. Some proxies remove this custom HTTP header. If this occurs, the server handles the request as a regular postback, which causes a client error. To resolve this issue, insert a custom form field when you perform asynchronous posts. Then check the header or the custom form field in server code. UpdatePanel Usage You can use multiple UpdatePanel controls to update different page regions independently. When the page that contains one or more UpdatePanel controls is first rendered, all the content of all UpdatePanel controls are rendered and sent to the browser. On subsequent asynchronous postbacks, the content of each UpdatePanel control might not be updated depending on the panel settings and on client or server logic for individual panels. You can also use UpdatePanel controls in the following scenarios: In user controls. On master and content pages. Nested inside  UpdatePanel controls. Inside templated controls such as the GridView or Repeater controls. UpdatePanel controls can be added declaratively or programmatically. You can add an UpdatePanel control programmatically, but you cannot add triggers programmatically. To create trigger-like behavior, you can register a control on the page as an asynchronous postback control. You do this by calling the RegisterAsyncPostBackControl method of the ScriptManager control. You can then create an event handler that runs in response to the asynchronous postback, and in the handler, call the Update method of the UpdatePanel control. Applying Styles The UpdatePanel control accepts expando attributes. This lets you set a CSS class for the HTML elements that the controls render. For example, you might create the markup shown in the following example:  The markup in the previous example renders HTML similar to the following when the page runs:    Declarative Syntax
Example: The following examples show different uses of the UpdatePanel control. Controls Inside an UpdatePanel Control The following example shows how to put controls inside an UpdatePanel control to reduce screen flicker when you post to the server. In this example, a Calendar and a DropDownList control are inside an UpdatePanel control. By default, the UpdateMode property is Always and the ChildrenAsTriggers property is true. Therefore, child controls of the panel cause an asynchronous postback.  Master/Detail Scenario with UpdatePanel Controls In the following example, an UpdatePanel control is used in a master/detail scenario that shows orders and order details from the Northwind database. One UpdatePanel control contains the GridView control that displays a list of orders. A second UpdatePanel control contains a DetailsView control that displays the details of one order. When you select an order from the first table, details for that order are displayed in the second table. The second table is updated asynchronously based on the selection in the first table. The sorting and paging operations in the orders summary table also cause partial updates.   <%@ Page Language=## %> <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC #-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN# #http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd#> <script runat=#server#> protected void GridView1_SelectedIndexChanged(object sender, EventArgs e) { SqlDataSource2.SelectParameters[#OrderID#].DefaultValue = GridView1.SelectedDataKey.Value.ToString(); } </script> <html xmlns=#http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml#> <head id=#Head1# runat=#server#> <title>UpdatePanel Example</title> </head> <body> <form id=#form1# runat=#server#> <div> <asp:ScriptManager ID=#ScriptManager1# runat=#server# /> <asp:UpdatePanel ID=#OrdersPanel# UpdateMode=#Conditional# runat=#server#> <ContentTemplate> <asp:GridView ID=#GridView1# AllowPaging=#True# AllowSorting=#True# Caption=#Orders# DataKeyNames=#OrderID# DataSourceID=#SqlDataSource1# OnSelectedIndexChanged=#GridView1_SelectedIndexChanged# runat=#server# > <Columns> <asp:CommandField ShowSelectButton=#True#></asp:CommandField> </Columns> </asp:GridView> <asp:SqlDataSource ID=#SqlDataSource1# runat=#server# ConnectionString=#<%$ ConnectionStrings:NorthwindConnectionString %># SelectCommand=#SELECT [OrderID], [CustomerID], [EmployeeID], [OrderDate] FROM [Orders]#> </asp:SqlDataSource> </ContentTemplate> </asp:UpdatePanel> <asp:UpdatePanel ID=#OrderDetailsPanel# UpdateMode=#Always# runat=#server#> <ContentTemplate> <asp:DetailsView ID=#DetailsView1# Caption=#Order Details# DataKeyNames=#OrderID,ProductID# DataSourceID=#SqlDataSource2# runat=#server#> <EmptyDataTemplate> <i>Select a row from the Orders table.</i> </EmptyDataTemplate> </asp:DetailsView> <asp:SqlDataSource ID=#SqlDataSource2# ConnectionString=#<%$ ConnectionStrings:NorthwindConnectionString %># SelectCommand=#SELECT [OrderID], [ProductID], [UnitPrice], [Quantity], [Discount] FROM [Order Details] WHERE ([OrderID] = @OrderID)# runat=#server#> <SelectParameters> <asp:Parameter Name=#OrderID# Type=#Int32# /> </SelectParameters> </asp:SqlDataSource> </ContentTemplate> </asp:UpdatePanel> </div> </form> </body> </html> If you put a GridView control inside an UpdatePanel control, setting the GridView control's EnableSortingAndPagingCallbacks property to true is not supported. However, because the UpdatePanel control supports asynchronous postbacks, any postbacks that change the GridView control inside an UpdatePanel control cause the same behavior as sorting and paging callbacks. Using an UpdatePanel Control in a Template In the following example, an UpdatePanel control is used in the item template of a GridView control. UpdatePanel controls in each data row are generated automatically.

The conversation scope is active:

    * during all standard lifecycle phases of any JSF faces or non-faces
      request.

The conversation context provides access to state associated with a 
particular conversation. Every JSF request has an associated conversation. 
This association is managed automatically by the container according to the 
following rules:

    * Any JSF request has exactly one associated conversation.
    * The conversation associated with a JSF request is determined at the
      beginning of the restore view phase and does not change during the
      request.

Any conversation is in one of two states: transient or long-running.

    * By default, a conversation is transient
    * A transient conversation may be marked long-running by calling 
      Conversation.begin()
    * A long-running conversation may be marked transient by calling 
      Conversation.end()

All long-running conversations have a string-valued unique identifier, 
which may be set by the application when the conversation is marked 
long-running, or generated by the container.

If the conversation associated with the current JSF request is in the 
transient state at the end of a JSF request, it is destroyed, and the 
conversation context is also destroyed.

If the conversation associated with the current JSF request is in the 
long-running state at the end of a JSF request, it is not destroyed. 
Instead, it may be propagated to other requests according to the following 
rules:

    * The long-running conversation context associated with a request that
      renders a JSF view is automatically propagated to any faces request
      (JSF form submission) that originates from that rendered page.
    * The long-running conversation context associated with a request that
      results in a JSF redirect (a redirect resulting from a navigation
      rule or JSF NavigationHandler) is automatically propagated to the
      resulting non-faces request, and to any other subsequent request to
      the same URL. This is accomplished via use of a GET request parameter
      named cid containing the unique identifier of the conversation.
    * The long-running conversation associated with a request may be
      propagated to any non-faces request via use of a GET request
      parameter named cid containing the unique identifier of the
      conversation. In this case, the application must manage this request
      parameter.

When no conversation is propagated to a JSF request, the request is 
associated with a new transient conversation. All long-running 
conversations are scoped to a particular HTTP servlet session and may not 
cross session boundaries. In the following cases, a propagated long-running 
conversation cannot be restored and reassociated with the request:

    * When the HTTP servlet session is invalidated, all long-running
      conversation contexts created during the current session are
      destroyed, after the servlet service() method completes.
    * The container is permitted to arbitrarily destroy any long-running
      conversation that is associated with no current JSF request, in order
      to conserve resources.

Syntax: [ActivityValidatorAttribute(typeof(StateActivityValidator))] [ComVisibleAttribute(false)] [ToolboxBitmapAttribute(typeof(StateMachineWorkflowActivity), #Resources.StateMachineWorkflowActivity.png#)] public class StateMachineWorkflowActivity : StateActivity
Summary: Serves as the root container for state machine workflows. Contains event-driven activities and states.
Remarks: The StateMachineWorkflowActivity is an activity container used to create workflows that follow a state machine model. The StateMachineWorkflowActivity is a CompositeActivity, which means the StateMachineWorkflowActivity can contain other activities. The StateMachineWorkflowActivity and the EventDrivenActivity activities are the only permitted child activities of the StateMachineWorkflowActivity. EventDrivenActivity activities are permitted because the root activity itself behaves like a state. Therefore, you can have EventDrivenActivity activities at the root level that are used by all the State activities in the StateMachineWorkflowActivity. EventDrivenActivity activities at this level provide a global mechanism for processing workflow events and automate state transitions. StateActivity activities provide a mechanism to define the various stages in the model. The StateMachineWorkflowActivity has properties that are required for the execution of the state machine workflow. Most notably, the StateMachineWorkflowActivity has two properties that are important: InitialStateNameProperty and CompletedStateNameProperty. The InitialStateNameProperty of the state machine is the state in which the state machine is when an instance of the state machine is created. The InitialStateNameProperty property is mandatory and must be provided when a StateMachineWorkflowActivity is created. The InitialStateNameProperty of the state machine is like any other state activity that is contained within the state machine. The state activity can be a direct child of the StateMachineWorkflowActivity root activity and a StateMachineWorkflowActivity can have only one InitialStateNameProperty. The CompletedStateNameProperty of the StateMachineWorkflowActivity is a StateActivity activity that is designated as the end state of the StateMachineWorkflowActivity. When a transition is made to the CompletedStateNameProperty, the workflow execution is completed. The CompletedStateNameProperty is not mandatory. This means that you can have a StateMachineWorkflowActivity that is not completed. This does not mean that the state machine workflow is always active in memory. The StateMachineWorkflowActivity might be unloaded as it waits for an event. StateMachineWorkflowActivity activities that never complete are especially useful in processing long running business transactions, as in the case of a purchase order received by a supplier. The fact that the purchase order was fulfilled does not mean that the purchase order process is over. The goods that are part of the purchase order might be returned or the purchase order might be amended and have additional items added to it after the fulfillment. Sometimes there might be a requirement to keep the purchase order records for an extended period of time for legal or other purposes. The fact that a workflow does not finish just means that the workflow remains in an unloaded state. There may be a case for retiring the workflows, which means that after a set period of time the workflow instance may be forced to shut down.
Example: The following code example shows how to create a new instance of the StateMachineWorkflowActivity class and use it to implement a basic state machine to transition between three states. This code example is part of the SimpleStateMachineWorkflow SDK sample from the StateMachineWorkflow.cs file. For more information, seeSimple State Machine.

32620,447584,451328,8,public interface ResultSet   ,"A table of data representing a database result set, which is usually 
generated by executing a statement that queries the database.

A ResultSet object maintains a cursor pointing to its current row of data. 
Initially the cursor is positioned before the first row. The next method 
moves the cursor to the next row, and because it returns false when there 
are no more rows in the ResultSet object, it can be used in a while loop to 
iterate through the result set.

A default ResultSet object is not updatable and has a cursor that moves 
forward only. Thus, you can iterate through it only once and only from the 
first row to the last row. It is possible to produce ResultSet objects that 
are scrollable and/or updatable. The following code fragment, in which con 
is a valid Connection object, illustrates how to make a result set that is 
scrollable and insensitive to updates by others, and that is updatable. See 
ResultSet fields for other options.

  Statement stmt = con.createStatement( ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE, ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE); ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(SELECT a, b FROM TABLE2); // rs will be scrollable, will not show changes made by others, // and will be updatable  

The ResultSet interface provides getter methods (getBoolean, getLong, and 
so on) for retrieving column values from the current row. Values can be 
retrieved using either the index number of the column or the name of the 
column. In general, using the column index will be more efficient. Columns 
are numbered from 1. For maximum portability, result set columns within 
each row should be read in left-to-right order, and each column should be 
read only once.

For the getter methods, a JDBC driver attempts to convert the underlying 
data to the Java type specified in the getter method and returns a suitable 
Java value. The JDBC specification has a table showing the allowable 
mappings from SQL types to Java types that can be used by the ResultSet 
getter methods.

Column names used as input to getter methods are case insensitive. When a 
getter method is called with a column name and several columns have the 
same name, the value of the first matching column will be returned. The 
column name option is designed to be used when column names are used in the 
SQL query that generated the result set. For columns that are NOT 
explicitly named in the query, it is best to use column numbers. If column 
names are used, the programmer should take care to guarantee that they 
uniquely refer to the intended columns, which can be assured with the SQL 
AS clause.

A set of updater methods were added to this interface in the JDBC 2.0 API 
(JavaTM 2 SDK, Standard Edition, version 1.2). The comments regarding 
parameters to the getter methods also apply to parameters to the updater 
methods.

The updater methods may be used in two ways:

   1. to update a column value in the current row. In a scrollable 
      ResultSet object, the cursor can be moved backwards and forwards, to
      an absolute position, or to a position relative to the current row.
      The following code fragment updates the NAME column in the fifth row
      of the ResultSet object rs and then uses the method updateRow to
      update the data source table from which rs was derived.

        rs.absolute(5); // moves the cursor to the fifth row of rs rs.updateString(NAME, AINSWORTH); // updates the // NAME column of row 5 to be AINSWORTH rs.updateRow(); // updates the row in the data source  

   2. to insert column values into the insert row. An updatable ResultSet 
      object has a special row associated with it that serves as a staging
      area for building a row to be inserted. The following code fragment
      moves the cursor to the insert row, builds a three-column row, and
      inserts it into rs and into the data source table using the method 
      insertRow.

        rs.moveToInsertRow(); // moves cursor to the insert row rs.updateString(1, AINSWORTH); // updates the // first column of the insert row to be AINSWORTH rs.updateInt(2,35); // updates the second column to be 35 rs.updateBoolean(3, true); // updates the third column to true rs.insertRow(); rs.moveToCurrentRow();  

A ResultSet object is automatically closed when the Statement object that 
generated it is closed, re-executed, or used to retrieve the next result 
from a sequence of multiple results.

The number, types and properties of a ResultSet object's columns are 
provided by the ResulSetMetaData object returned by the 
ResultSet.getMetaData method.
